# Weather Minimalist Clean Arch Application Case Study

## About
Android native kotlin application using open weather api data to test concepts and validate ideas.  

## Steps into building the solution and trade offs
- Clean architecture showcase separating concerns of presentation domain and data.
- Consuming weather data from https://open-meteo.com/
- Using well known libs as Retrofit, Gson and Picasso for handling api communication and image downloading
- Now testing concepts on simple animations and architecture 
- Later testing Jetpack new libs, caching, advanced animations, DI with hilt and more :}  

That's it folks, cheers!
